// The following function is meant to log the city for a customer’s shipping address. However, the code is unsafe and may throw runtime errors due to missing or undefined properties.

// Without changing the logic of the function, **fix the typing issues** and **make the function safe** using proper TypeScript types.

// ```tsx
interface Address {
  city: string;
}
interface Customer {
  name: string;
  address: Address;
}
interface Order {
  customer: Customer;
}
const logOrder = (order: Order) => {
  console.log(`Shipping to:${order.customer.address.city}`);
};

logOrder({
  customer: {
    name: "Jane",
    address: {
      city: "Kigali",
    },
  },
});
